I was experimenting with C++ due to an on-line course
I am currently taking.
An exercise called for generating Fibonacci numbers.
Decided to experiment and here it is.

Remember that one of the best ways to learn and refresh 
your knowledge is to read and experiment, and repeat.
Practice makes perfect.

Enjoy;
